# Eincode App Templates

This is a CLI tool to scaffold new React projects (or other frameworks) with a single command. It allows you to easily create a boilerplate app from predefined templates.

## Features

- Multiple templates (e.g., `react-quickstart`, and you can add more in the `templates/` directory)
- Zero-config setupâ€”just run a single command to scaffold a new project
- Flexible usage: direct CLI execution or using `pnpm create`
